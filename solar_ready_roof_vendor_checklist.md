# Solar-Ready Roof Vendor Checklist

Use this checklist to ensure your new roof is durable, solar-compatible, and that your chosen vendor is prepared to coordinate with a solar panel installation—either now or in the future.

---

## 1. Roof Type & Material

- [ ] What roofing materials do you recommend for durability and snow load?  
  - [ ] Standing seam metal (preferred for solar)
  - [ ] Synthetic/composite (please specify brand/type)
  - [ ] Other: _____________________

- [ ] Is this roof type compatible with solar panel installation?
- [ ] What is the manufacturer’s warranty on the roofing material?
- [ ] Does the warranty remain valid with solar panels installed?

---

## 2. Solar Mounting & Attachment

- [ ] Are non-penetrating solar mounts (e.g., S-5! clamps for metal) available for this roof?
- [ ] If penetrations are required, what is your process for waterproof flashing and sealing?
- [ ] Do you (the roofing company) install solar mounting hardware, or coordinate with a solar installer?
- [ ] Have you worked with solar installers before? Can you recommend any?
- [ ] Will you coordinate the installation timeline with the solar installer?

---

## 3. Structural & Snow Considerations

- [ ] What is the roof’s snow load rating (in Pascals or lbs/ft²)?
- [ ] Is the recommended pitch/angle of the roof suitable for solar and snow shedding?
- [ ] Will the roof structure require reinforcement for solar panels and snow loads?

---

## 4. Installation, Permits, and Maintenance

- [ ] Do you handle all necessary permits (roofing and/or solar)?
- [ ] Will your team be available for maintenance or repairs under/around solar panels?
- [ ] Are there any restrictions or recommendations for roof color or finish with solar (e.g., darker colors for snow melt)?

---

## 5. Cost and Timeline

- [ ] Can you provide a detailed quote for:
    - [ ] The roof installation
    - [ ] Solar mounting hardware (if included)
    - [ ] Coordination with solar installer (if applicable)
- [ ] What is the estimated installation timeline?

---

## 6. References & Experience

- [ ] Can you share references for similar projects (metal/synthetic roofs with solar)?
- [ ] Are you certified or recommended by the roof material manufacturer for solar installations?

**Tip:** Always confirm in writing that adding solar will not void your roof warranty, and that the roofer and solar installer are willing to coordinate on your project.
